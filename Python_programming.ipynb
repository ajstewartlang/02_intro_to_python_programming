The next bit of code creates a list called `my_numbers` that contains 4 integer elements. Remember, in contrast to R, Python uses zero-position indexing. So the first element in the list is at position 0, the second at position 1 etc. We can index an element in the list using square brackets. Let's index the second element..."

For example, imagine I want to display someone’s BMI on the basis of knowing their height (in metres) and mass (in kg). The formula for BMI is: BMI = kg/m2. Let’s write a function that takes as its input someone’s weight and height, and then returns their BMI. We use `def` to define our function that we're calling `bmi`. It takes two parameters, `weight` and `height`. Inside the body of the function it creates a new variable called `bmi_value` which is `weight` divided by `height` squared. The function then returns this value.\n",

This means that this loop will run exactly twice, each time printing the `i`th element in the list."
