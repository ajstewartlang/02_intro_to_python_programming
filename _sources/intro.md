Andrew's BIOL63162 Workshops
============================

This website contains the material I teach on the BIOL63162 Scientific Programming, Computational Tools and Machine Learning unit.

Each of the sessions is intended to run as a ~2 hour workshop. Each contains a mix of recorded material, written material, and some challenges for you to work on.

The workshops can be found via the index on the left under the 'Content' heading. We'll be covering the following topics:

   - Using Conda to create reproducible Python environments
   - Programming in Python using Jupyter Notebooks
   - Data analysis using the Numpy and pandas libraries
   - Using git and GitHub for version control and collaborative working
   - Making your analyses reproducible using Docker and Dockerhub

If you have any questions, please feel free to email at drandrewjstewart@gmail.com or send me a DM on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ajstewart_lang).


This website was written using Jupyter Book and was very much inspired (by the UBC Jupyter Days Book)https://ubc-dsci.github.io/jupyterdays/index.html
