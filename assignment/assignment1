Assignment 

The data in the file 
(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajstewartlang/02_intro_to_python_programming/main/data/ANOVA_data2.csv) are 
from a reaction time experiment but with a slightly more complex design. 48 participants responded to a word 
that differed in how frequent it was. This factor is between participants and we have four levels coded as ‘very 
low’, ‘low’, ‘high’, and ‘very high’. Our DV is reaction time and is coded as ‘RT’. Subject number is coded as 
‘Subject’. We want to know if there is a difference between our conditions (and if so, where that difference 
lies).

You need to read in the data, build the appropriate ANOVA, and then determine which difference(s) are driving 
the effect.
