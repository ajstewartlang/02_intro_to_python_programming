    "This is a Jupyter Notebook. It allows use to write text in Markdown format (as we have in this block), and also run Python code and see the output. If you have completed the previous workshop, you should be able to launch a Jupyter Notebook on your own machine. Make sure you have a conda environment activated (type `conda activate` in your terminal if you don't). Set up a new Notecook by typing `jupyter notebook` in a terminal window. This should launch Jupyter Notebooks running in your browser. \n",

You can check what type a variable by using `type()`.\n",

You can use variables to store values that you need to be able to access later, and variables can be re-assigned as your script progresses (maybe to store temporary values). You can print the content of a variable using the `print(variable_name)` function in Python. In the code below, we create two variables. The print() function can take multiple arguments so we can print the values of the two variables with the line `print(my_favourite_number_text, my_favourite_number)`.\n"
