The next bit of code creates a list called `my_numbers` that contains 4 integer elements. Remember, in contrast to R, Python uses zero-position indexing.

We then create an array of random integers from 0 (inclusively) and 10 (exclusively) that has 3 rows and 4 columns. We use the Numpy routine `random` and the operation `randint` to generate this array. We need to specify the low and high values of the range we're sampling from, and the shape of the array (number of rows by number of columns) we are wanting to generate."

    "If you find yourself writing the same chunk of code again and again, you might want to turn it into a function. For example, imagine I want to display someone’s BMI on the basis of knowing their height (in metres) and mass (in kg). The formula for BMI is: BMI = kg/m2. Let’s write a function that takes as its input someone’s weight and height, and then returns their BMI. We use `def` to define our function that we're calling `bmi`. It takes two parameters, `weight` and `height`. Inside the body of the function it creates a new variable called `bmi_value` which is `weight` divided by `height` squared. The function then returns this value.\n",

    "We can then call the function to work out the bmi of someone with a weight of 87 kgs, and a height of 1.8 metres with with `bmi(87, 1.8)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in the code below we are using indentation for the body of the function. Indentation in Python is important and is meaningful (i.e., it's not an aesthetic decision). Indentation is used to indicate a block of code. The convention is to indent each line of a block by 4 spaces. "
