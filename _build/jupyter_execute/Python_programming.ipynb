The next bit of code creates a list called `my_numbers` that contains 4 integer elements. Remember, in contrast to R, Python uses zero-position indexing. So the first element in the list is at position 0, the second at position 1 etc. We can index an element in the list using square brackets. Let's index the second element..."

We then create an array of random integers from 0 (inclusively) and 10 (exclusively) that has 3 rows and 4 columns. We use the Numpy routine `random` and the operation `randint` to generate this array. We need to specify the low and high values of the range we're sampling from, and the shape of the array (number of rows by number of columns) we are wanting to generate."
