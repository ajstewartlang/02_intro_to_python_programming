Andrew's BIOL63162 Workshops
============================

This website contains the material I teach on the BIOL63162 Scientific Programming, Computational Tools and Machine Learning unit.

Each of the sessions is intended to run as a ~2 hour workshop. Each contains a mix of recorded material, written material, and some challenges for you to work on.

Each of the workshops can be found via the index on the left. We'll be covering the following topics:

   - Using Conda to create reproducible Python environments
   - Programming in Python using Jupyter Notebooks
   - Data analysis using the Numpy and pandas libraries
   - Using git and GitHub for version control and collaborative working
   - Making your analyses reproducible using Docker and Dockerhub
