If you have completed the previous workshop, you should be able to launch a Jupyter Notebook on your own machine. Make sure you have a conda environment activated (type `conda activate` in your terminal if you don't). Set up a new Notecook by typing `jupyter notebook` in a terminal window. This should launch Jupyter Notebooks running in your browser. \n",

You can print the content of a variable using the `print(variable_name)` function in Python. In the code below, we create two variables. The `print` function can take multiple arguments so we can print the values of the two variables with the line `print(first_variable_name, second_variable_name)`.\n"

In Python lists are indicated by square brackets, `[` and `]`, and contain elements - often of the same type - for example, lists of integers, strings etc. Lists can also contain a mix of elements of different types (but you may want to avoid this). The next bit of code creates a list called `my_numbers` that contains 4 elements. Remember, in contrast to R, Python uses zero-position indexing. So the first element in the list is at position 0, the second at position 1 etc. We can index an element in the list using square brackets. Let's index the second element..."
