Each of the sessions is intended to run as a ~2 hour workshop. Each contains a mix of recorded videos, written material, and some challenges for you to work on.

The workshops can be found via the index on the left under the 'Content' heading. We'll be covering the following topics across 5 workshops:

   - Using Conda to manage your Python libraries and create reproducible Python environments.
   - Programming in Python using Jupyter Notebooks.
   - Data analysis using the NumPy and pandas libraries.
   - Making your analyses reproducible using Docker and Dockerhub.   
   - Using git and GitHub for version control and collaborative working.

This website was built using [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) and was very much inspired by the [UBC Jupyter Days Book](https://ubc-dsci.github.io/jupyterdays/index.html) course material.
